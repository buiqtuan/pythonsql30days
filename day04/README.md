# Day 4: Loops & List Comprehensions

## Learning Objectives

- Master `for`, `while`, `break`, and `continue`
- Use list comprehensions for efficient list creation

## Theory (2 hours)

### For Loops
- Iterating over sequences (lists, strings, ranges)
- Using `range()` function for numeric loops
- Nested loops for complex iterations

### While Loops
- Condition-based looping
- Infinite loops and how to avoid them
- Loop control with `break` and `continue`

### List Comprehensions
- Syntax: `[expression for item in iterable]`
- Conditional list comprehensions
- Nested list comprehensions
- Performance benefits over traditional loops

## Practical Exercises (2 hours)

- Create a list of even numbers under 50 using a loop and a comprehension
- Compute factorial using a while loop

## Files to Work With
