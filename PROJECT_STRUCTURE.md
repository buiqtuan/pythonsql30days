- File I/O and CSV handling
- Error handling and standard libraries

#### Phase 3: Python Advanced Concepts (Days 13-20)
- Object-oriented programming
- Library management and testing
- Data analysis with Pandas and NumPy
- Integration project

#### Phase 4: SQL Fundamentals (Days 21-27)
- Database concepts and design
- SQL queries: basic to advanced
- Performance optimization
- Python-SQL integration

#### Phase 5: Capstone Project (Days 28-30)
- Project design and planning
- Implementation and testing
- Demo and code review

### 🎯 Daily Structure

Each day includes:
- **README.md**: Learning objectives, theory overview, exercise descriptions
- **exercises/**: Hands-on programming practice
- **solutions/**: Example solutions (complete after attempting exercises)
- **resources/**: Data files, additional materials, references

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   cd pythonsql30days
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   pip install -r day15/exercises/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Daily Workflow**:
   - Start with `dayXX/README.md`
   - Work through exercises in order
   - Test your code thoroughly
   - Review solutions only after completing exercises

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - [ ] Week 1: Days 1-7 (Python Basics)
   - [ ] Week 2: Days 8-14 (Data Structures & OOP)
   - [ ] Week 3: Days 15-21 (Libraries & SQL Intro)
   - [ ] Week 4: Days 22-28 (Advanced SQL & Integration)
   - [ ] Final: Days 29-30 (Capstone Project)

### 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Consistency**: Study every day for 4 hours (2 theory + 2 practice)
2. **Hands-on**: Type all code yourself, don't copy-paste
3. **Understanding**: Focus on concepts, not just syntax
4. **Practice**: Complete all exercises before moving forward
5. **Review**: Regularly revisit previous concepts
6. **Community**: Join Python and SQL communities for support

### 📞 Support

- Each day includes additional resources and references
- Exercises are designed to build progressively
