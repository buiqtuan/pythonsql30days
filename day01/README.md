# Day 1: Introduction to Python & Development Environment

## Learning Objectives
- Install Python, VS Code or JupyterLab
- Use pip and virtualenv for environment management
- Understand REPL vs script mode and write your first program

## Theory (2 hours)

### Python Installation & Setup
1. Download and install Python from python.org
2. Verify installation with `python --version`
3. Install VS Code or set up JupyterLab
4. Configure Python extension in VS Code

### Virtual Environments
- Why virtual environments are important
- Creating virtual environments with `venv`
- Activating and deactivating environments
- Installing packages with `pip`

### Python Execution Modes
- **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**: Interactive Python shell
- **Script Mode**: Running Python files (.py)
- When to use each mode

## Practical Exercises (2 hours)

### Exercise 1: Environment Setup
Create a virtual environment for this course and install basic packages.

### Exercise 2: Hello World Program
Write your first Python program that displays 'Hello, Data!'

### Exercise 3: Data Types Exploration
Create a program that demonstrates different Python data types: int, float, str, bool.

## Files to Create
- `hello.py` - Your first Python program
- `data_types.py` - Data types demonstration

## Key Concepts
- Virtual environments
- Python installation
- REPL vs Script execution
- Basic data types

## Next Day Preview
Tomorrow we'll dive deeper into variables, data types, and operators to build our Python foundation.
