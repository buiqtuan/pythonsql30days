# Day 3: Conditional Statements

## Learning Objectives
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Apply comparison and logical operators

## Theory (2 hours)

### Conditional Statements
- Understanding boolean logic
- `if` statements for decision making
- `elif` for multiple conditions
- `else` for default cases

### Comparison Operators
- Equal to: `==`
- Not equal to: `!=`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than: `<`
- Greater than or equal: `>=`
- Less than or equal: `<=`

### Logical Operators
- `and`: Both conditions must be True
- `or`: At least one condition must be True
- `not`: Reverses the boolean value

### Conditional Best Practices
- Writing readable conditions
- Avoiding deeply nested if statements
- Using elif efficiently

## Practical Exercises (2 hours)

### Exercise 1: Grading System
Create `grading.py` to convert numeric scores to letter grades (Aâ€“F)

### Exercise 2: Number Checker
Write a program to check if a number is even or odd

### Exercise 3: Complex Conditionals
Build a program with multiple conditions using logical operators

## Files to Create
- `grading.py` - Grade conversion system
- `even_odd.py` - Even/odd number checker
- `age_category.py` - Age-based categorization

## Key Concepts
- if/elif/else structure
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Boolean evaluation

## Next Day Preview
Tomorrow we'll learn about loops (for and while) and list comprehensions for repetitive tasks.
